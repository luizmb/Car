/// view. Nothing about the root is special-cased — which is the point. A root that hands a bare `Store`
/// to a view silently never re-renders, because `Store` is not `@Observable`; the SwiftRex APIs that
/// tempt you into it (`binding` / `presence` / `item`) are declared on `StoreType`, which the concrete
/// `Store` also satisfies. Going through the standard `Feature` machinery means the root's view store is
/// built exactly the way every other screen's is, so that failure is not expressible here.
///
/// It is also the app's coordinator: it holds the `World`, constructs the ``AppRouter``, and injects it
/// into the root view. Child screens are created by that router on demand and never cached.
